# What's the goal?

<div class='notes'>
What is the goal?

Given this is the developer track at the open repositories conference in 2017, I am going to go assume none of us are working on Boeing guidance computers, or heart monitors. 

Most likely, we are building apps, or websites.

We are probably apart of some unique rube goldberg machine. Somewhere at the end of it their is a human their. And, they are trying to use our software â€¦ too do something.

If we are unlucky, that user is quietly resenting their screen, and wishes their boss had but another piece of software.

If we are doing just okay, they might not even notice our work as they go about their day.

If we are lucky, they might love what we make. They might love it so much they are singing our praises to everyone they know.

Our goal is to at least be okay, if not lucky.

Our goal is deliver something valuable to our users.

This is at least one way in which any kind of organization can align behind. IT/Engineering/"The Business"/"The Management" they can all agree that delivering value to your users is good, and should be a goal.

Today, I want to talk to you about Continuous integration, and delivery. I want to talk to you about how these ideas can not only help you deliver value, but how they can accelerate that process. And, it might even make your day to day work a little more fun.

# Quick History

The philosophical origin of Continuous Integration and Devilry is almost 100 Yeas old, far before "IT" was ever a thing. 

In some sense, that's why it's so powerful these ideas have been tested, again and again and continue to demonstrate results, even when they are applied to more abstract processes like software development.

<div class="notes">
Many of todays continuous integration, and delivery practices are highly influenced by the lean manufacturing movement, which in turn was highly influenced by various manfuacting philosophies developed in Japan after WW2, which was influenced by this guy Edward Deming.

# How do we achieve the goal?

1. Focus on end-to-end flow
2. Fast Feedback
3. Continuous Improvement

<div class="notes">
These are known as the 3 ways

# Risk vs Reward

* Every new feature is a risk
* Every change can break old features
* Every line of code is an investment

* Reduce risk

# how does CI provide 

- Unit test on each commit
- Offers fast feed back
- A precommit check will keep your trunk clean
- allowed developers to build conventions through lint

I think the goal is for users to derive value from our software. And, for that value to grow over time.

# how do we create value?

1. Create New valuable features
2. Maintains existing valuable features
3. Remove non-valuable features
4. Continuously improve the process for delivering value






The goal of software is usually to deliver value to users. 

If you are google, customers should be able to search
If you are twitter, people should be able to tweet
If you are a repository people should be able to deposit things.

# value is 

- is multifaceted
- Value is created through investment
