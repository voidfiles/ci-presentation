# Hi.

<div class="notes">I am a software architect at bepress</div>

---

# I deliver value to customers

<div class="notes">When people ask what I do, I like to tell them, 'I deliver value to customers.'</div>

---

# My medium is websites, mostly

<div class="notes">I mostly build websites, and that's important, because much of my talk is contextual. For instance, I don't build software that powers heart implants or airplane guidance software.</div>

---

# I **try** to deliver value to customers.

<div class="notes">What I should probably tell people is that I try to deliver value to customers. Because, as we all know there is no guarantee that any of the things we build will work, let alone deliver value.</div>

---

# Value is when a customer use's your feature

<div class="notes">No amount of unitests or end to end tests or QA testing can prove that you have delivered value. Value is when a customer use's your feature. Preferably, in a real context.</div>

---

# Real value is when lots customers use it.

<div class="notes">For us, real value is when lots of customers use our feature.</div>

---

# Future success depends on attracting new customers with all the value we afford them

<div class="notes">The goal is to not only keep our current customers happy by maintaining value, but also our future success depends on attracting new customers with all the value we afford them.</div>

---

# But, we already do that.

<div class="notes">You might say, 'But, we already do that. We have a product organization that validates new features so we don't spend time working on duds.</div>

---

# No one bats 1000.

<div class="notes">I would say that is true, we have great business partners, but no one bats a 1000.</div>

---

# 10 at bats are better then 1

<div class="notes">We should focus on having more attempts at new features. 10 at bats are better then 1. The more chances we have to deliver software means we have more chances to deliver value.</div>

---

# Our people are our greatest resource.

<div class="notes">And when we set out to increase the value we deliver to our customers we should use our most valuable resource, our people. Our people are our greatest resource.</div>

---

# A continuous process is the best way to efficiently let our people deliver our to your customers.

<div class="notes">I came here today to talk about continuous integration and delivery because I think they are a powerful toolset that people can use to deliver value to our customers, but these tools are only useful in an organization that recognizes the power of unleashing its human potential. So, before I dive into ci and cd I have to contextualize them.</div>
---

# It's pretty simple.

<div class="notes">In theory it's pretty simple, and yet I could spend hours diving into the details, so here is the basics.</div>

---

1. Vision
2. Empower our people
3. Try lots of things
4. Measure outcomes

<div class="notes">In order to unleash your human potential you must create a virtuous cycle that encompasses these steps. Vision, empowerment, try lots of things, and measurement outcomes. If you have ever heard of the OODA loop, or the plan do check act cycle, you know what I am talking about here, but let me dive into each step in more detail.</div>

---

# Vision is how you align all the people, it's the why to the goals what.

<div class="notes">People want to do the best thing they can, but often they are confused as to the best course of action. Having a vision is a great way to make plain what you are trying to do so that people can figure out what to do next. Vision is how you align all the people, it's the why to the goals what.</div>

---

# Empower people to align their teams with the overall vision and goals

<div class="notes">Now that people know where they are headed. We should empower them to find the best course of action.</div>

---

# Measuring outcomes allows teams to know if they are hitting the mark

<div class="notes">People naturally want to produce good outcomes. Measuring the outcomes allows teams to know if they are hitting the mark. When the contribute to a good outcome they feel good and they feel valued.</div>

---

# A continuous process can help us unlock the power of our people.

<div class="notes">The good news is that a continuous process can help us unlock the power of our people.</div>

---

# A continuous process is just a small part of the overall plan

<div class="notes">But the bad news is that a continuous process is a small part of the over all plan.</div>

---

# Tools empower our people

<div class="notes">We must recognize that tools empower our people to execute the vision, and that our people should be at the center of this discussion.</div>

---

# What about the tools, tho

<div class="notes">Right now you might be saying, what about the tools though, so here is my crib notes. If anyone wants to talk more in detail I am more then willing to, I could geek out on this stuff all day.
</div>
---

1. Lots of small commits (300 lines or less)
1. Use a pre-commit phase
1. Master should always be green
1. Deploy to production from master
1. Deploy on demand, as often as is sustainable

<div class="notes">I've done ci and cd for over 8 years, at 4 different companies, on countless products and these are the most important things that I have learned.

- read them

We practice these tenants on every product at bepress and we've had some hairy times over the last few years that I can't imagine getting through without these tools and we are still figure out how to empower our people.

# Our people are our greatest asset. We should not squander them. Let them use tools to empower them selves.

<div class="notes">In summary, our people are our greatest asset and we should not squander them. Tell them where we should go and why. Empower them to make contextual decisions on how to move towards the goal. Remember, there are no straight paths to the promised land, help teams increase the number experiments they are doing over time. Measure key outcomes so teams may know that they are moving in the right direction. Use CI and CD. Finally, damnit, just get out of their way.
